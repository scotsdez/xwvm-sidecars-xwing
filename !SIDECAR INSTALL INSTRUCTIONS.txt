XWVM - X-Wing Campaign Sidecars
===============================

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install the sidecars in XWVM, the process is straightforward:

* Navigate to the XWVM user data directory. On Windows, this will generally be in the form of: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\XWVM .
* Extract the sidecar files into the GlobalSidecars directory. i.e. after extraction, files should be located at C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\XWVM\GlobalSidecars\ACKBAR.xwvm , and so on.
* Start XWVM, and play a mission (historical or TOD), e.g. X-Wing Historical Mission 1 (Dev's Sidestep). As you play the mission, dialogue messages should appear in the message log (and as subtitles, depending on your player settings).

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the sidecars are not appearing when playing missions, check the following:

* XWVM version - you should be playing the latest alpha version for the sidecars to work correctly. Check the XWVM Discord to verify the latest version available.
* Confirm the installation directory is as listed above. You should also observe similar directories alongside GlobalSidecars, such as droids, pilots, etc.
* Check your in-game settings under Audio and Language to confirm if subtitles are enabled.
